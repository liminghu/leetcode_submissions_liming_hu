// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray

/*
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
