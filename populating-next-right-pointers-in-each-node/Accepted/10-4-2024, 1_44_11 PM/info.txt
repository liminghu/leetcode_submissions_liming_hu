If there is no next right node, the next pointer \nshould be set to NULL.\nInitially, all next pointers are set to NULL.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\nOutput: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]\nExplanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to \npoint to its next right node,\njust like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' \nsignifying the end of each level.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: root = []\nOutput: []\n \n\nConstraints:\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n \nFollow-up:\nYou may only use constant extra space.\nThe recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.\n*/\n/*\n// Definition for a Node.\nclass Node {\npublic:\n    int val;\n    Node* left;\n    Node* right;\n    Node* next;\n\n    Node() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}\n\n    Node(int _val) : val(_val), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}\n\n    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next)\n        : val(_val), left(_left), right(_right), next(_next) {}\n};\n*/\n\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    Node* connect(Node* root) {\n        if( root==NULL )\n            return NULL;\n        if( root->left==NULL && root->right == NULL)\n            return root;\n        queue<Node*> q;\n        q.push(root);\n        while(!q.empty()) {\n            int size = q.size();\n            for(int i=0; i<size; i++) {\n                Node* f = q.front();\n                q.pop();\n                if(f->left)\n                    q.push(f->left);\n                if(f->right)\n                    q.push(f->right);\n                if( i != size-1 ) //the row last Node next will point to NULL.\n                    f->next = q.front();\n                else\n                    f->next = NULL;\n            };\n        };\n        return root;\n    }\n};","compare_result":"11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
