You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the \nith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.\n\nWe want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according \nto the following rules:\n\nEvery worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.\nIn the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a worker’s quality is \ndouble that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.\nGiven the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. \nAnswers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n*/\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    static bool cmp(pair<int,int>&a, pair<int,int>&b) {\n        return a.second*1.0/a.first < b.second*1.0/b.first;\n    }\n    \n    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int k) {\n        /*  n == quality.length == wage.length\n            1 <= k <= n <= 104\n            1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 104\n        */\n        vector<pair<int,int>> persons;\n        for(int i=0; i<quality.size();i++) {\n            persons.push_back({quality[i], wage[i]});\n        }\n\n        sort(persons.begin(), persons.end(), cmp);\n\n        priority_queue<int> pq_quality; //max\n        int sum_quality = 0;\n        double ret = 1e30;\n\n        for(int i=0; i<persons.size(); i++) { //unit page is increasing.\n            double unitWage = persons[i].second * 1.0/persons[i].first;\n            sum_quality += persons[i].first;\n            pq_quality.push(persons[i].first);\n            if(pq_quality.size() > k) {\n                sum_quality -= pq_quality.top();\n                pq_quality.pop();\n            }\n\n            if(pq_quality.size() == k) {\n                ret = min(ret, unitWage*sum_quality);\n            }\n        }\n        return ret;\n    }\n};","compare_result":"111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
