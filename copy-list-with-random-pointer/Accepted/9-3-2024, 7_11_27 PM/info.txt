The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of \nits corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers\n in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.\nFor example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the \ncopied list, x.random --> y.\nReturn the head of the copied linked list.\nThe linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes.
