You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\nArrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon\n with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that\n can be shot.
