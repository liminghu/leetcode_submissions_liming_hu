There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\nClarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n*/\n/**\n * Definition for a binary tree node.\n * struct TreeNode {\n *     int val;\n *     TreeNode *left;\n *     TreeNode *right;\n *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}\n * };\n */\nclass Codec {\npublic:\n\n    // Encodes a tree to a single string.\n    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {\n        //inorder, postorder\n        string str = \"\";\n        if(root == NULL)\n            str += \"null\\n\";\n        else {\n            str += to_string(root->val)+ \"\\n\";\n            str += serialize(root->left);\n            str += serialize(root->right); \n        };\n        return str;\n    }\n\n    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.\n    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {\n        istringstream in(data);\n        return deserialize(in);\n    }\n    TreeNode* deserialize(istringstream& in) {\n        string val;\n        in >> val;\n        if(val == \"null\")\n            return NULL;\n        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode( stoi(val) );\n        root->left = deserialize(in);\n        root->right = deserialize(in);\n        return root;\n\n    }\n};\n\n// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:\n// Codec ser, deser;\n// TreeNode* ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root));","compare_result":"11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
