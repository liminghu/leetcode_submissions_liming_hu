        /*As the attendance records is made by 3 characters ('P', 'L', 'A'), the total number can be divided into
            Total = ended with P + ended with L + ended with A.
            If we define following series
            T(n) is the total number of all possible attendance records with length n.
            P(n) is the total number of all possible attendance records ended with 'P' with length n.
            L(n) is the total number of all possible attendance records ended with 'L' with length n.
            A(n) is the total number of all possible attendance records ended with 'A' with length n.
            It can be inferred that
            T(n) = A(n) + P(n) + L(n), n â‰¥ 1.
