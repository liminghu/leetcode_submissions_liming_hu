Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical,\n diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, \nwhere births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the\n next state.\nConstraints:\nm == board.length\nn == board[i].length\n1 <= m, n <= 25\nboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\nFollow up:\n\nCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update\n some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\nIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would\n cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border).\n  How would you address these problems?\n */\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {\n        int m = board.size();\n        int n;\n        if(m==0) \n            n = 0;\n        else\n            n = board[0].size();\n        //board[i][j]: 0(dead), 1(live)\n        \n        for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n            for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                int lives = 0;\n                for(int y=max(0, i-1); y<min(m, i+2); y++) {\n                    for(int x=max(0, j-1); x<min(n, j+2); x++) {\n                        lives += board[y][x] & 1;\n                    }\n                }\n                //Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n                int cell_live = board[i][j] & 1;\n                if( cell_live && (lives-cell_live) < 2)\n                    board[i][j] += 0; //second bit to 0. \n                //Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n                if( cell_live && ( (lives-cell_live) == 2 || (lives-cell_live) == 3) )                \n                    board[i][j] += 2; //second bit to 1. \n                //Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n                if( cell_live && ( (lives-cell_live) > 3 ) )                \n                    board[i][j] += 0; //second bit to 0. \n                //Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n                if( (cell_live==0) && ( (lives-cell_live) == 3 ) )\n                    board[i][j] += 2; //second bit to 1.\n            }\n        }\n\n        for(int i=0; i<m; i++) {\n            for(int j=0; j<n; j++) {\n                board[i][j] >>= 1; //right shift 1 bit.\n            }\n        } \n    }\n};","compare_result":"11111111111111111111111","title_slug":"game-of-life","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
