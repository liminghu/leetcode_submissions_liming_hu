// https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query

/*
You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.

You are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.

Return an array containing the answers to the queries.
1 <= intervals.length <= 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107
1 <= queries[j] <= 107
