Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The \ntime taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.\n\nEach vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals \nchange at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot \nwait at a vertex if the signal is green.\n\nThe second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.\n\nFor example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4.\nGiven n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.\n\nNotes:\n\nYou can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.\nYou can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.\n*/\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    int secondMinimum(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int time, int change) {\n        vector<int> next[n+1];\n        for( auto edge:edges) {\n            int a = edge[0]; \n            int b = edge[1];\n            next[a].push_back(b);\n            next[b].push_back(a);\n        }\n\n        vector<int> visited(n+1, 0);\n        vector<int> dist(n+1, -1);\n        queue<pair<int,int>> q; // <int, arrive time>\n        q.push({1,0});\n        dist[1] = 0;\n        \n        while(!q.empty()) {\n            auto [cur, t] = q.front();\n            q.pop();\n\n            int tt;\n            int round = t /change;\n            if(round % 2 == 0) //green;\n                tt = t+time;  //The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.\n            else \n                tt = (round+1)*change + time;\n            \n            for(int nxt: next[cur]) {\n                if( visited[nxt] < 2 && dist[nxt] < tt ) {\n                    dist[nxt] = tt;\n                    visited[nxt]++;\n                    q.push({nxt, tt});\n\n                    if(nxt==n && visited[nxt]==2)\n                        return tt;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        return -1;\n    }\n};","compare_result":"1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111","title_slug":"second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination","has_notes":false,"flag_type":1}
