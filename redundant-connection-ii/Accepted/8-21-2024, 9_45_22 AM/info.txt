The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not \nan edge that already existed.\nThe resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [ui, vi] that represents a \ndirected edge connecting nodes ui and vi, where ui is a parent of child vi.\nReturn an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of n nodes.
