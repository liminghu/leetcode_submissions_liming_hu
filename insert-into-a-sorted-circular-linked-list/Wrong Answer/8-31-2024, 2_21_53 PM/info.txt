The given node can be a reference to any single \nnode in the list and may not necessarily be the smallest value in the circular list.\nIf there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, \nthe circular list should remain sorted.\nIf the list is empty (i.e., the given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference \nto that single node.
